The webshop should contain at least 20 products with realistic data.
Continuous testing of code is required during development.
All forms should be validated as per the methods taught in class.
Specific User Stories

As a visitor, I want to add a product to a shopping cart for purchasing multiple items at once.
For VG: As a visitor, I want to search for products by name or category for quick navigation. (Search should be "smart", working on partial names and regardless of case.)

For VG: As an administrator, I want changes to be protected by login credentials to prevent unauthorized access. (Login with username=admin and password=password).
Testing and Feedback

Providing constructive feedback on a group member's design sketch.
Reviewing a group member's code and providing feedback.
Testing a user flow scenario and documenting the tester's reactions using an empathy map.
Assessment
To achieve a passing grade (G), the following criteria must be met:

Achievement of course goals
Fulfillment of all listed requirements
Collaboration within the assigned test group
To achieve a higher grade (VG), additional criteria must be demonstrated, including a deeper understanding of scalability, well-structured code, thoughtful testing, and insightful feedback.
